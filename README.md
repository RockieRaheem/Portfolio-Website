Containerized Portfolio Website with Docker and CI/CD Pipeline
This repository contains a simple web application containerized using Docker. It also integrates a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.

This project demonstrates how to:

Create a simple web application.
Containerize the application using Docker.
Set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker
Git
A GitHub account (to clone and push the repository)
[Optional] Kubernetes (for orchestration in case of scaling the application)
Steps to Run the Application Locally
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/containerized-web-app.git
cd containerized-web-app
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-web-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-web-app
Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the application.

Dockerization
In this project, the application is packaged into a Docker container. Below is the content of the Dockerfile that defines the containerization process:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Use a base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the application source code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
This project uses GitHub Actions to set up a CI/CD pipeline. The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file. The pipeline automates:

Running tests (if any).
Building the Docker image.
Deploying the container (this can be to any cloud provider or server).
